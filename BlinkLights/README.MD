<h1>SC126 Random Blinking Lights</h1>
<p>This program simply blinks lights randomly on the SC126.  Currently, 5 I/O ports are used.  Port 0x0D is the onboard lights, while ports 1-4 are I/O
modules which are plugged into the board.</p>
<p>Once you run the program, you can press values from 1 to 9 on the console to set the speed.  Valid characters for speed will echo back to the console.  
Obviously, Control-C will exit the program.<p>
<p>I've tested the assembly using SLR180 by SLR Systems<p>
