# SC126 Z180
Programs for the SC126 Stephen Cousins Computer<p>
This is simply a collection of some programs I've written for the SC126.   The SC126 is designed by Stephen C Cousins, and you can find a unit at <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/tindiescx/sc126-z180-sbcmotherboard-kit-for-rcbus/">this link.</a><p>
Although I want these projects to be functional and accurate, I make no claims that they are.  Please let me know if you find errors, or wish to request that other features be added to the projects.<p>
